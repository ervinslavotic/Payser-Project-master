		<h3>Goal</h3>
		Payser is open to all users and employers for free account setup. Employers will be able to provide<br>
		their employees with lighting fast synchronization of their payslips and from here our service could lead<br> 
		to a more personalized and privatized environment on Payser. Our goal is to grow into a service which <br>
		synchronizes all sorts of personal documents securely online, amid payslips with employers, <br>
		also personal tax documents with the tax office, collages letters from collage etc.  <br>

			<h3>Payser</h3>
			Payser serves as a front-end web application for the user developed in Python. This is the way in which 
			the user will interact with the application and we will provide full control to the user regarding their 
			account and personal data. Presenting the application as a friendly UI is a reletivly simple development 
			and also effective since it removes the hassle of the user having to worry about the back-end needs and 
			requirements.

		<h3>Architecture</h3>
		The Architecture of the Payser Project consists of three distinct attributes. The first is the back-end aspect 
		which is the framework used to develop the service which is WebApp2 and also Jinja which is a Python based 
		framework for linking HTML templates.</br> WebApp2 is linked directly to the GAE which gives us full control over
		what we want to have in our System.

		<h3>Frameworks</h3>
		There are two main frameworks used in the development of the application and these are WebApp2 and Jinja.
		Webapp2 is a framework which is directly linked to the GAE and needs only to be imported in Pythons source
		codes of all forms within the application and after we have imported these libraries from Webapp2 we can use 
		its functions within each python script. Jinja is also a web framework which enables us to develop dynamic
		web applications. It has various features to make loading various HTML templates a lot more simpler. 
		</br>
		Simply by declaring a Jinja environment within each script we can efficiently develop a highly responsive
		user interface and eye catching designs. The user does not see this aspect of the appliction.

			<h3>DataStore</h3>
			Data is stored using users' existing gmail accounts and we provide a link for sign up aswell.
			Since we are using GAE we are enabled to use data from users via their Gmail/Google accounts
			and setup these accounts in our datastore. The Datastore holds data about the user and their
			attributes. It is used to store various data types.
